# PSO-FinalProject - Particle Swarm Optimization for Blood donorâ€™s availability pattern 

Particle swarm optimization (PSO) is a population based stochastic optimization technique developed by Dr. Eberhart and Dr. Kennedy  in 1995, inspired by social behavior of bird flocking or fish schooling.

PSO shares many similarities with evolutionary computation techniques such as Genetic Algorithms (GA). The system is initialized with a population of random solutions and searches for optima by updating generations. However, unlike Genetic Algorithm, PSO has no evolution operators such as crossover and mutation. In PSO, the potential solutions, called particles, fly through the problem space by following the current optimum particles. 
Compared to Genetic Algorithm, the advantages of PSO are that PSO is easy to implement and there are few parameters to adjust. PSO has been successfully applied in many areas: function optimization, artificial neural network training, fuzzy system control, and other areas where Genetic Algorithm can be applied.

## Problem Statement:
In a situation of blood donor requirement or more importantly, when there is an emergency needing blood donors at the earliest, there is no optimal way to find out the best possible donor that satisfies the requirement. This can be more specifically attributed that finding a donor with the same blood group of the requirement in the emergency and the one closest to the emergency/requirement location is essentially the key objective behind the problem. 
It is never known of what the optimized location is to look for when there is a specific need of a blood group. If this is known, blood can be donated on time and many valuable lives can be saved.
